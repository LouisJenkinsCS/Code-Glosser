 *
 * The Perfect Game is a game between two players; a Human player and an AI. The
 * implementor of this must handle determining if either player has won the game
 * and printing out the actual board. The PerfectGame handles processing each
 * player turn.
 * 
 * The AI is implemented with a modified version of the minimax algorithm, which
 * originally this was supposed to follow precisely, except due to a certain
 * bug in the algorithm preventing the AI from winning the game, merely always
 * resulting in a draw. Hence, it has been modified to be more greedy, and hence
 * vulnerable to losing. If it is possible, within the next move, to win the
 * game, it will attempt to do so, while also resulting in negligence in the
 * long-term predictions, allowing the Human player to win the game.
