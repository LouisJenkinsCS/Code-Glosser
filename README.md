# Code Gawker
This is a NetBeans IDE module that displays highlighted source code in a separate customizable window.

<hr>

After highlighting text in a source file, the user can activate Code Gawker in one of three ways:

<ol>
<li>Click the Code Gawker icon in toolbar.</li>
<li>Right click in source file for context menu, and select Code Gawker.</li>
<li>Click on View menu in toolbar and select Code Gawker.</li>
</ol>

A top-level floating window appears containing the highlighted text. If the user resizes the window, the text size adjusts automatically to span the height of the window. 

Right clicking in the window opens a context menu with several options:

<ul>
<li><strong>Colors.</strong>
    Opens a custom dialog that enables the user to select background and foreground colors.
</li>

<li><strong>Save.</strong> Opens file navigator so that the user can specify a file name and location for saving the text in the window.
</li>

<li><strong>Print.</strong>
Prints the text in the window.
</li>

<li><strong>Always on Top.</strong>
Enables the user to specify whether or not the window will remain on top of all other windows.
</li>
</ul>
