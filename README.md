# Code Gawker

<strong>Code Gawker</strong> is a NetBeans IDE plug-in that displays source code hightlighted in the IDE's editor in a separate customizable window. This capability can be used by an instructor of a programming class for making easy side-by-side comparisons of code fragments from different source files or from different parts of the same source file. 

<h3>Usage</h3>

First, the user highlights a code fragment to be displayed:

```
<img align="center" src="screenshots/highlight.png" width = "600" alt="highlight source code">
```

The user can create a window containing the fragment by clicking on the <strong>Code Gawker</strong> icon in the IDE's menu bar, or by selecting <strong>Code Gawker</strong> from the View menu:

<img src="screenshots/menu.png" width = "600" alt="select Code Gawker">

Alternatively, the user can right click in the editor window and select <strong>Code Gawker</strong> from the context menu:

<img src="screenshots/menu2.png" width = "600" alt="select Code Gawker">

A window is created containing the highlighted text:

<img src="screenshots/window.png" width = "600" alt="window created">

The <strong>Code Gawker</strong> window provides options through a context menu:

<img src="screenshots/alwaysontop.png" width = "600" alt="options">

If the user selects Colors, a dialog box appears that can be used to set the background and foreground colors:

<img src="screenshots/colors2.png" width = "600" alt="colors">

The font size can be manipulated by resizing the window. The code fragment will be rendered in such a way as to span the height of the window. The width of the window is adjusted as needed so that the text fits precisely:

<img src="screenshots/colors.png" width = "600" alt="colors">
