# Code Gawker

**Code Gawker** is a NetBeans IDE plug-in that displays selected source code in a separate top-level customizable window. It can be used by an instructor of a programming class for making easy side-by-side comparisons of code fragments from different source files or from different parts of the same source file. 

<h4>Usage</h4>

Use the mouse to highlight a code fragment to be displayed:

Create a window containing the selected fragment by clicking on the <strong>Code Gawker</strong> icon in the IDE's menu bar or by selecting **Code Gawker** from the View menu:

Alternatively, right click in the editor window and select **Code Gawker** from the context menu:

A top-level window is created containing the highlighted text:

The **Code Gawker** window provides several options through a context menu:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src="screenshots/alwaysontop.png" width = "600" alt="options">

Selects Colors for a dialog to set the background and foreground colors:

Change the font size by resizing the window. The code fragment will always span the height of the window, and its width will be adjusted to fit the text precisely.
