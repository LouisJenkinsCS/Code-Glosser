# Code Gawker

**Code Gawker** is a NetBeans IDE plug-in that displays selected source code in a separate top-level customizable window. It can be used by an instructor of a programming class for making easy side-by-side comparisons of code fragments from different source files or from different parts of the same source file. 

<br>
Use the mouse to highlight a code fragment to be displayed:

<br>
Create a window containing the selected fragment by clicking on the <strong>Code Gawker</strong> icon in the IDE's menu bar or by selecting **Code Gawker** from the View menu:

<br>
Or right click in the editor window and select **Code Gawker** from the context menu:

<br>
A top-level window will be created containing the highlighted text with the name of the source file in the title bar:

<br>
The **Code Gawker** window provides several options through its own context menu (via right click):

<br>
For example, select Colors for a dialog to set the background and foreground colors:

<br>
Change the font size by resizing the window. The code fragment will always span the height of the window, and its width will be adjusted to fit the text precisely.
